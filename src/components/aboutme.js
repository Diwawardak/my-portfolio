                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

                <p>I am a Junior Software Developer and have successfully completed the Master Coding bootcamp at Code Nation. I found the 12 weeks of intensive training exciting and stimulating, the experience has proven my ability to learn rapidly and develop a coding skillset that I would like to pursue further. I enjoy the problem solving aspect of coding and I believe it is a skill extremely integral to the world we live in now. My First Class Honours degree in Animation has also enabled me to develop and enhance my skills in design and editing software such as Adobe After Effects, Premier Pro and Photoshop. I enjoy the freedom that comes along with coding and the ability to be as creative and innovative as possible. My background makes me a product-driven designer and I am interested in combining programming with animation to utilise it effectively and create interactive experiences.</p>
